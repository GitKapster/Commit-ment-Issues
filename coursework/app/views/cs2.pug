block section_aiming_overview
  | Aiming in CS2 requires precision and control
  | The game rewards methodical positioning and first-bullet accuracy with high damage headshots
  | All weapons have movement inaccuracy factors, with standing still being essential for maximum precision
  | Success in duels heavily depends on your crosshair placement, recoil control, and understanding weapon spray patterns

block section_aiming_styles
  | Different aiming styles develop based on roles, preferences and weapon choices
  | Entry fraggers often use higher sensitivity for quick flicks and checking multiple angles when entering sites
  | AWPers and support players might prefer lower sensitivity for holding angles and making precise shots
  | Your weapon choice also impacts your ideal sensitivity - rifle players need good spray control while AWPers need precision for single shots

block section_aiming_tip
  | "Crosshair placement is everything. If your crosshair is already at head level where enemies will peek, you've already won half the battle." - s1mple

block section_mouse_control
  | Consistent mouse control is key in CS2 where headshots and spray control determine the outcome of fights
  | Finding a sensitivity that lets you control both micro-adjustments and spray patterns is important
  | Your setup should allow for both precision and the ability to react to flanks

block section_sensitivity
  | A good starting point is ensuring you can do a 180° turn in one mousepad swipe
  | Lower sensitivities (400-800 eDPI) are common among pros for better spray control
  | Consider your desk space, mousepad size, and arm/wrist aiming preference
  | Most pro players use between 600-1200 eDPI (mouse DPI × in-game sensitivity)

block section_crosshair_placement
  | Good crosshair placement is the foundation of effective CS2 aiming.
  | Always keep your crosshair at head level and pre-aim common angles.
  | As you move around the map, constantly adjust your aim to where enemies are most likely to appear, this is called pre aiming.
  | This minimizes the adjustments needed when an enemy appears, giving you faster time-to-kill.

block crosshair_design
  | Creating your perfect crosshair is one of the most important tasks as a new player, it is very easy to be overstimulated by the amount of choice and customization.
  | Most players chose to go for a small simple crosshair with a static style, but many also like thick bulky crosshairs with dynamic styles it is all upt to preference.
  | A small, visible crosshair helps with precision without obscuring targets.
  | Static crosshairs are preferred by most players as they provide consistent feedback without additional clutter and distraction on the screen.
  | Many professional players use a simple dot or small cross with a gap in the middle.

block section_movement_overview
  | Movement in CS2 is a key skill that separates good players from great ones
  | Counter-strafing (tapping the opposite movement key to stop quickly) is essential for accurate shooting
  | Proper peeking techniques like shoulder peeking, jiggle peeking, and wide swings give you advantages in duels
  | Advanced movement techniques like bunny hopping and air strafing can provide tactical advantages in certain situations

block practice_overview
  | Our practice routine focuses on: Crosshair Placement, Counter-Strafing, Spray Control, and Utility Usage

block practice_routine
  .practice-container
    div.practice-item 1. Warm up with aim_botz or other workshop maps (15 mins)
    div.practice-item 2. Practice spray patterns on recoil master map (10 mins)
    div.practice-item 3. Work on movement and counter-strafing (10 mins)
    div.practice-item 4. Practice utility lineups for your main maps (15 mins)
    div.practice-item 5. Deathmatch focusing on headshots only (20 mins)
    div.practice-item 6. Review your recent demos to identify areas for improvement

block section_overview
  | Becoming proficient in CS2 requires consistent practice of these fundamental mechanics
  | Focus on developing good habits early rather than trying to fix bad ones later
  | Remember that game sense and positioning are just as important as mechanical skill
  | Stay patient - improvement takes time but follows consistent practice
