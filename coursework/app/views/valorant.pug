block section_aiming_overview
  | Aiming is the most fundamental skill in FPS games. While natural talent plays a role,
  | proper technique and consistent practice can dramatically improve anyone's aim.
  | This guide breaks down the key components of elite-level aiming.

block section_aiming_sensitivity
  | Finding your perfect sensitivity is crucial. We recommend starting with a medium-low
  | sensitivity that allows you to comfortably do a 180-degree turn with one full swipe
  | across your mousepad. For most players, an eDPI between 200-400 is ideal.
  |
  | Formula: eDPI = DPI Ã— In-game sensitivity

block section_aiming_crosshair
  | Always keep your crosshair at head level and pre-position it where enemies are likely
  | to appear. This reduces the distance you need to move your mouse when an enemy appears,
  | giving you a crucial time advantage in firefights.

block section_aiming_tip
  | "I spend 15 minutes before every practice session in the aim trainer focusing only on
  | micro-adjustments. Small corrections are what separate good aimers from great ones."
